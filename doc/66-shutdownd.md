# 66-shutdownd

The daemon that manages the shutdown procedure for a [66-boot](66-boot.html) installation. It is not meant to be called directly. This program is a modified copy of [s6-linux-init-shudownd](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/s6-linux-init-shutdownd.html). 

## Interface

```
    66-shutdownd [ -h ] [ -l live ] [ -s skel ] [ -g gracetime ]
```

- 66-shutdownd opens the `%%livedir%%/scandir/0/shutdownd/fifo` pipe and listens to it. Programs such as [66-shutdown](66-shutdown.html) send their commands to this pipe when they are told to trigger the shutdown procedure.

- When it receives a command to shut down *66-shutdownd* parses the skel file `rc.init`—defined by default at `%%skel%%` directory— and reads the value of `RCSHUTDOWN` to be able to spawn the `rc.shutdown` script.

- When said script exits *66-shutdownd* kills all processes first with a `SIGTERM` then, after the grace time specified by the shutdown command, with a `SIGKILL`.

- It then runs an automatically generated script called `stage4` which unmounts all file systems and halts, powers off or reboots the machine.

## Exit codes

- *0* success
- *100* wrong usage
- *111* system call failed

## Options

- **-h** : prints this help.

- **-l** *live* : changes the supervision directory of *service* to *live*. By default this will be `%%livedir%%`. The default can also be changed at compile time by passing the `--livedir=live` option to `./configure`. An existing absolute path is expected and should be within a writable filesystem - likely a RAM filesystem—see [66-scandir](66-scandir.html).

- **-s** *skel* : an absolute path; directory of the skeleton file `rc.init`. Default is `%%skel%%`.

- **-g** *gracetime* : specify a grace time between the `SIGTERM` and the `SIGKILL` in milliseconds if the shutdown command does not provide one. Defaults to `3000`.

## Note

The *66-shutdownd* binary is not meant to be called directly. It is automatically generated by a [66-scandir](66‑scandir.html) program invocation.
