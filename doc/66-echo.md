# 66-echo

Exact copy of [s6-echo](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-echo.html). Adapted to the `66` suite to avoid a dependency on [s6-portable-utils](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/) at compilation time of `66`. Details and further information on the command can be found at the [s6-echo](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-echo.html) documentation page.
