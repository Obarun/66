# enable

This command enables one or more services within a specified *tree* depending of the method used.

## Interface

```
enable [ -h ] [ -S ] service(s)
```

This tool will also parse the service if it was never parsed. In this case, it expects to find a corresponding [frontend service file](frontend.html), or a *service* instance (see [instance](#Instantiated service)), by default at `%%service_adm%%` or `%%service_system%%` in this order of precedence for root user and `$HOME/%%service_user%%`, `%%service_adm%%` or `%%service_system%%` in this order of precedence for a normal user. The default path can be changed at compile time by passing the `--with-system-service=DIR`, `--with-sysadmin-service=DIR` and `--with-user-service=DIR` to `./configure`.The *service* will then be available in the given *tree* for the next boot depending on the state of the *tree*. The targeted service(s) can also be started on the fly when enabling it with the **-S** option.

wThe given *tree* can be define through the `-t` option in the `66` general option or by using the `@intree` field within the frontend file or setting a current tree through the [66 tree current](66-tree.html) subcommand. If neither `-t` options nor `@intree` is provided, or if no tree is marked as a current one, it will enable the service within the default tree named `%%default_treename%%`. The default tree name can be changed at compile time by passing the `--with-default-tree-name` to `./configure`.

Multiple *services* can be enabled by seperating their names with a space.

## Options

- **-h** : prints this help.

- **-S** : starts the *service* on the fly directly after enabling it. If the state of the *service* is already up, this option will have no effect.

## Usage example

Enable a service while specifying with the tree name:

```
66 -t treeA enable foo
```

Enable an instanced service:

```
66 enable foo@foobar
```

Enable and start the service, also increase the default verbosity:

```
66 -v3 enable -S foo
```

## Exit codes

- *0* success
- *100* wrong usage
- *111* system call failed

## Dependency handling

Any existing dependency chain will be automatically resolved. It is unnecessary to manually define chained sets of dependencies. If FooA has a declared dependency on another service with the name FooB then FooB will be automatically enabled too when enabling FooA. This works recursively until all necessary dependencies are enabled.

## Instantiated service

An instanced *service* name from a service template can be passed as argument where the name of the *service* must end with a `@` (commercial at).â€”see [frontend service file](frontend.html).

**(!)** The name of the template must be declared first immediately followed by the instance name.

```
66 enable foo@foobar
```
