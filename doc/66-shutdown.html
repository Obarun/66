<h1> 66-shutdown</h1>
	<p>
		<tt>66-shutdown</tt> triggers the system shutdown procedure. It is normally invoked as <tt>shutdown</tt> at your binary system directory. This program is a modified copy of <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/s6-linux-init-shutdown.html">s6-linux-init-shudown</a> program.
	</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     66-shutdown [ -H ] [ -l live ] [ -h | -p | -r | -k ] [ -a ] [ -t <em>sec</em> ] [ -f | -F ] <em>time</em> [ <em>message</em> ]
     66-shutdown -c [ <em>message</em> ]
</pre>

	<ul>
		 <li> If the <tt>-c</tt> option is present, a pending shutdown is cancelled. </li>
		 <li> Else, it plans the shutdown procedure at time <em>time</em>. </li>
		 <li> If a <em>message</em> argument has been given, <em>message</em> is
		broadcast to all logged in users (as tracked by utmp). </li>
		 <li> <tt>shutdown</tt> exits 0. The shutdown procedure happens asynchronously. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	 The <tt>66-shutdown</tt> program conforms to the LSB-3.0.0
	<a href="http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/shutdown.html">shutdown</a>
	interface.
	</p>

	<p>
		 <em>time</em> must follow the following format:
		<tt>[&nbsp;now&nbsp;|&nbsp;[+]<em>mins</em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<em>hh</em>:<em>mm</em>&nbsp;]</tt>
	</p>

	<ul>
		 <li> <tt>now</tt> means: trigger the shutdown sequence immediately. </li>
		 <li> <em>hh</em>:<em>mm</em> means: absolute time. Trigger the shutdown sequence when the time
		<em>hh</em>:<em>mm</em> occurs. If that time has passed for the day, it will wait for the
		next day. <em>hh</em> must have 1 or 2 digits; <em>mm</em> must have 2 digits. </li>
		 <li> <em>mins</em> or <tt>+</tt><em>mins</em> means: relative time. Trigger the shutdown
		sequence after <em>mins</em> minutes. </li>
	</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			 <tt>-H&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: prints this help.
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: <em>live</em> directory to use. <tt>66-shutdown</tt> sends signal the pipe of the <a href="66-shutdownd.html">66-shutdownd</a> service at <tt><em>live</em>/scandir/0/shutdownd/fifo</tt>. Default is
			<tt>/run/66</tt>. The default can also be changed at compile-time by
			passing the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt> option to <tt>./configure</tt>. 
			An absolute path is expected and should be under a writable filesystem 
			- likely a RAM filesystem.
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-a</tt>&nbsp;: access control. The shutdown sequence will only be
			launched if one of the users listed in <tt>/etc/shutdown.allow</tt>
			is currently logged in (as tracked by utmp). <tt>/etc/shutdown.allow</tt>
			is a text file, one user per line, lines starting with <tt>#</tt> are comments. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-t</tt>&nbsp;<em>sec</em>&nbsp;: at the end of the shutdown sequence,
			when it's time to kill all processes, have a "grace time" period
			of <em>sec</em> seconds between the SIGTERM and the SIGKILL (to allow processes
			receiving SIGTERM to exit cleanly). Default is 3 seconds. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<tt>-k</tt>&nbsp;: warning only. <em>message</em> will be sent to all
			logged in users, but the shutdown sequence will not be triggered. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-h</tt>&nbsp;: at the end of the shutdown sequence, halt the system.
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-p</tt>&nbsp;: at the end of the shutdown sequence, power off the system.
			(This option is provided as an extension, it is not required by the LSB interface.) 
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-r</tt>&nbsp;: at the end of the shutdown sequence, reboot the system.
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-f</tt>&nbsp;: ignored. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-F</tt>&nbsp;: ignored. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>-c</tt>&nbspl: cancel a planned shutdown (i.e. cancel the effect of a
			previous call to <tt>shutdown</tt> with a <em>time</em> argument that was not <tt>now</tt>).
			This cannot be used to interrupt a shutdown sequence that has already started. 
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Notes </h2>

	<ul>
		<li> 
			The <tt>66-shutdown</tt> binary is not meant to be called directly by administrators. Instead, use the <tt>shutdown</tt> <em>skel</em> file installed by default at <tt>/etc/66</tt> directory. This <strong>should be copied or symlinked</strong> by the administrator into the binary directory of your system.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <tt>-f</tt> and <tt>-F</tt> options are only accepted for compatibility. LSB says they are used to advise the system to skip or enforce a <tt>fsck</tt> after rebooting. But they are only advisory, and for decades now systems have used other methods of evaluating whether they should perform filesystem checks, so these options are largely obsolete nowadays.
		</li>
	</ul>
