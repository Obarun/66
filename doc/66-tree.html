<h1>66-tree</h1>

	<p>
      This command handles a directory containing a set of services.
    </p>

<h2> Interface </h2>
	<pre>
	66-tree [ -h help ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -n new ] [ -a allow <em>user,user,...</em> ] [ -d deny <em>user,user,...</em> ] [ -c current ] [ -E enable ] [ -D disable ] [ -R remove ] [ -C <em>clone</em> ] tree"
	</pre>

	<p>
      66-tree will handle a set of any kind of services into <em>tree</em>. 
      <em>tree</em> will be handled for the current user of the process. 
      Each <em>tree</em> are completely independent from each other. If you 
      want to know which tree are currently available on the system use
      <tt><a href="66-info.html">66-info</a></tt> tool.
    </p>

<h2> Options </h2>

	<ul>
	 <li> <tt>-h&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: print the help. </li>
	 
	 <li>
		<tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em>&nbsp;</tt>: increase/decrease 
		the verbosity of the command. <tt>1(Default)</tt>: Only print 
		error messages. <tt>2</tt>: Also print warning messages. 
		<tt>3</tt>: Also print debugging messages.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li>
		<tt>-n&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: create a new empty <em>tree</em>. <em>tree</em>
		doesn't exist yet on the system.
	 </li>
	 <li> 
		<tt>-a&nbsp;<em>user</em></tt>&nbsp;: allow <em>user</em> to deal with
		<em>tree</em>. <em>user</em> can be any valid user on the system. <em>user</em>
		need to be the name of the user. A list of <em>user</em> separated by comma is allowed.
		This options is used to set the uid,gid of a service database at the compilation time. 
		That's mean that an undefined <em>user</em> is automatically denied for the given <em>tree</em>.
		By default the current user of the process is automatically allowed when the <em>tree</em> is created.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-d&nbsp;<em>user</em></tt>&nbsp;: deny <em>user</em> to deal with
		<em>tree</em>. <em>user</em> can be any valid user on the system. <em>user</em>
		need to be the name of the user. A list of <em>user</em> separated by comma is allowed.
	</li>
	 
	 <li>
		<tt>-c&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: make <em>tree</em> as current. The majority of the 66 tools
		have a <tt>-t</tt> options used to specify the <em>tree</em> to use. It can be
		really annoying to specify this options for each command executed. When you set
		<em>tree</em> as current all other 66 tools know the <em>tree</em> to use
		by default and avoid to specify it each time.Also, you can see which
		<em>tree</em> is the current one with the <tt><a href="66-info.html">66-info</a></tt> tool.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-E&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: enable <em>tree</em>. This options
		allow the <tt><a href="66-all.html">66-all</a></tt> tool to know which tree 
		need to be started. If <em>tree</em> is enabled, all services into <em>tree</em> 
		will be started when you use the <tt>66-all</tt> tool.  	
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-D&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: disable <em>tree</em>. This is the strict
		reverse of the <tt>-E</tt> options.  	
	 </li>	 
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-R&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: Remove <em>tree</em>. Delete <em>tree</em>
		from the system. This options cannot be reversed, you will not able
		to retrieve any information of the <em>tree</em> after the use of this
		options.  	
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-C&nbsp;<em>clone</em></tt>&nbsp;: make a strict copy of <em>tree</em>
		named <em>clone</em>. This is usefull to create a backup of <em>tree</em> or
		to start a new tree from an existing one. <em>clone</em> doesn't exist yet 
		on the system.
	 </li>
	</ul>

<h2> How it works </h2>

	<p>At the creation time, by default the <em>tree</em> will be created at 
	<tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em></tt> for root and <tt>$HOME/.66/system/<em>tree</em></tt>
	for an user. The base name of the directory, it mean <tt>/usr/lib/66/,$HOME/.66/</tt>, can also be changed
	at compile-time by passing the <tt>--with-system-dir=<em>DIR</em></tt> option 
	for root and <tt>--with-user-dir=<em>DIR</em></tt> for an user to <tt>./configure.</tt> 
	When you e.g enable a service as root, the resulting file service parser process will be
	written at <tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/svc</tt>
	for a service with "classic" type and at <tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/db/source</tt> 
	for a service as <em>bundle,longrun,oneshot</em> service type. <strong>Never</strong> 
	handles manually the directory and sub-directory of a <em>tree</em>. You will goes on trouble doing this.</p>
	<p>In fact, when you use 66 tools like <tt>66-enable,66-disable,66-start,66-dbctl,...</tt> the tool
	will go to the directory of the <em>tree</em> to find information about the service itself.
	For example when you ask to start all services of a <em>tree</em> with 
	<tt><a href="66-all.html">66-all</a></tt> tool,the directory 
	<tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/svc</tt> will be opened. For each
	service found into it <tt>66-all</tt> will start it. The process is a little different
	for a service as type <em>bundle,longrun,oneshot</em>. Instead of openning the directory <tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/db/source</tt>, 
	the corresponding compiled database found at 
	<tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/db/<em>tree</em></tt> will be used. This 
	compiled database is the resulting of an <tt><a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a></tt> 
	invocation at enable process time of the directory <tt>/usr/lib/66/system/<em>tree</em>/servicedirs/db/source</tt>.
