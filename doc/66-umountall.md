Exact copy of [s6-linux-init-umountall](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/s6-linux-init-umountall.html). It was adapted to avoid the dependency on [s6‑linux‑init](https://skarnet.org/software/s6‑linux‑init) at `66` compile time. Refer to the [s6‑linux‑init](https://skarnet.org/software/s6‑linux‑init) documentation page for further details.
