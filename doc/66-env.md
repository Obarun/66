# 66-env

Handles an environment file and variable of a service depending on the options passed.

## Interface

```
    66-env [ -h ] [ -z ] [ -v verbosity ] [ -t tree ] [ -c version ] [ -s version ] [ -V|L ] [ -r key=value ] [ -i src,dst ] [ -e editor ] service
```

- This program allows to handle the configuration file of *service* found by default at `%%service_admconf%%/<service>`. Depending of the options passed, you can displays the contents of the file, see the current version used, edits the configuration file and so on.

The edition of the configuration file is the **default** option if neither option is passed.

## Exit codes

- *0* success
- *100* wrong usage
- *111* system call failed

## Options

- **-h** : prints this help.

- **-z** : use color.

- **-v** *verbosity* : increases/decreases the verbosity of the command.
    * *1* : only print error messages. This is the default.
    * *2* : also print warning messages.
    * *3* : also print tracing messages.
    * *4* : also print debugging messages.

- **-t** : handles the *selection* of the given *tree*. This option is mandatory except if a tree was marked as 'current'â€”see [66-tree](66-tree.html).

- **-c** *version* : makes *version* as the current one to use by default. If the service is already running, you need to restart the *service* to apply the change by the command e.g. `66-start -r <service>`.

- **-s** *version* : specifies the version to handles with the options **-V**, **-L**, **-r** and **-e** instead of using the current one.

- **-V** : lists available versioned configuration directories of the *service*. The term `current` is used to specific the current version in use as follow:

    ````
        0.2.0
        0.1.4 current
    ````
- **-r** *key=value* : override an existing `key=value` pair with the given one. The `key=value` needs to be single quoted in case of multiple arguments.This option can be specified multiple times.

- **-L** : lists defined environment variables for the *service*. It do the same for all files found at the configuration directory.

- **-i** *src,dst* : imports configuration file from *src* version to *dst* version. The *src* version and *dst* version need to be separated by a comma without space before and after it. It **do not import** the configuration written by the `66-enable` process but only deal with extra configuration files written by the sysadmin.

- **-e** *editor*: edit the configuration file with *editor*. If you don't specify this option, it try to found the `EDITOR` variable from the environment variable. Note: the upstream file (meaning the one prefixed with a dot) is **never** touched. A copy of the upstream file is copied (if it doesn't exist yet) and the *66-env* tool modifies that file.(see [Service configuration file](service-configuration-file) for further information).

## Usage examples

```
    66-env -L ntpd

    66-env -r CMD_ARGS=-d

    66-env -r CMD_ARGS='-c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -g "daemon off;"'

    66-env -i 0.1.6,0.1.7 nginx

    66-env -V ntpd

    sudo 66-env -e nano ntpd

    66-env -s 0.1.6 ntpd
```

## Notes

Removing a *key* from the environment after the use can be handled by using an exclamation mark `!` at the begin of the value:

```
    66-env -r 'CMD_ARGS=!-c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -g "daemon off;"'
```
