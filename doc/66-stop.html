<h1>66-stop</h1>

	<p>
      This command stops one ore more <em>services</em> defined in <em>tree</em>.
    </p>

<h2> Interface </h2>
	<pre>
	66-stop [ -h help ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -t <em>tree</em> ] [ -T <em>timeout</em> ] [ -u unsupervise ] <em>service(s)</em>
	</pre>

	<p>
      This tool expects to find an already enabled service inside the given <em>tree</em> and started inside an already running <em>scandir</em>. 
      If the state of the <em>service</em> is already down, <tt>66-stop</tt> does nothing.
      Generally speaking this command is the strict opposite of the <tt><a href="66-start.html">66-start</a></tt> tool.</p>
    <p>Multiple <em>services</em> can be stopped by seperating their names with a space.</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

	<ul>
	 <li> <tt>-h&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: prints this help. </li>
	 
	 <li>
		<tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em>&nbsp;</tt>: increases/decreases 
		the verbosity of the command. <tt>1(Default)</tt>: Only print 
		error messages. <tt>2</tt>: Also print warning messages. 
		<tt>3</tt>: Also print debugging messages.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: changes the supervision directory of <em>service</em> to <em>live</em>. By default this will be <tt>/run/66</tt>. The default can 
		also be changed at compile time by passing the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt>
		option to <tt>./configure</tt>. An existing absolute path is expected and
		should be within a writable filesystem - likely a RAM filesystem&mdash;see <tt><a href="66-scandir.html">66-scandir</a></tt>.
	 </li>
	 <li> 
		<tt>-t&nbsp;<em>tree</em></tt>&nbsp;: stops the <em>service</em> from
		the given <em>tree</em>. This option is mandatory
		except if a tree was marked as 'current'&mdash;see <a href="66-tree.html"><tt>66-tree</tt></a>.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-T&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt></tt>&nbsp;: specifies a timeout (in milliseconds)
		after which <tt>66-stop</tt> will exit 111 with an error message if the service still hasn't reached the up state.
		By default, the timeout is 1000. 
	</li>
	 
	<li> 
		<tt>-u&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: unsupervise the <em>service</em>.
		Remove the <em>service</em> directory from the <em>scandir</em> at the end of the stop process. This options has only effect for service as <tt><em>'classic'</em></tt> type.
	 </li>	 

	</ul>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies handling</h2>
<p>In case of <tt><em>'bundle'</em></tt>, <tt><em>'longrun'</em></tt> or <tt><em>'oneshot'</em></tt> services, any dependency chain will be resolved automatically.
It is unnecessary to manually define chained sets of dependencies. If FooA has a declared dependency on FooB, 
FooB will be automatically considered and stopped first when stopping FooA.
This will run recursively until all dependencies are stopped.</p>

<h2>Classic service transitions</h2>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<tt>66-stop</tt> gathers the classic service(s) passed as argument in a list called <em>selection</em>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <em>selection</em> is inspected and searched for any logger that needs to be associated with the passed <em>service</em>. 
				If any such instruction was found the corresponding logger service will be added to the <em>selection</em> as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				The command sends a <tt>66-svctl -v <em>verbosity</em> -T <em>timeout</em> -l <em>live</em> -t <em>tree</em> -D <em>selection</em></tt> 
				and waits for the resulting exit code.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally the <em>service</em> directory is removed from the <em>scandir</em> in case of <tt><em>'classic'</em></tt> service type.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p>If any one of these processes fails then as a result <tt>66-stop</tt> fails too and exits with code 111.</p>
<h2>Bundle, longrun, oneshot transitions</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<tt>66-stop</tt> gathers the bundle, longrun and/or oneshot service(s) passed as argument in a list called <em>selection</em>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <em>selection</em> is inspected and searched for any logger that needs to be associated with the passed <em>service</em>. 
				If any such instruction was found the corresponding logger service will be added to the <em>selection</em> as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally the command sends a <tt>66-dbctl -v <em>verbosity</em> -T <em>timeout</em> -l <em>live</em> -t <em>tree</em> -d <em>selection</em></tt> 
				and waits for the resulting exit code.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p>If any one of these processes fails then as a result <tt>66-start</tt> fails too and exits with code 111.</p>
