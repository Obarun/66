<h1>66-enable</h1>

	<p>
      This command enables one ore more services inside a given <em>tree</em>.
    </p>

<h2> Interface </h2>
	<pre>
	66-enable [ -h ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -t <em>tree</em> ] [ -f ] [ -S ] <em>service(s)</em>
	</pre>

	<p>
      This tool expects to find a corresponding <a href="frontend.html">frontend service file</a>, a directory name (see <a href="#directory">below</a>) or a  <em>service</em> instance (see <a href="#instance">below</a>), by default at <tt>/etc/66/sysadmin/service</tt> or <tt>/etc/66/service</tt> in this order of precedence for root user and <tt>$HOME/.66/service</tt> or <tt>/etc/66/service</tt> in this order of precedence for a normal user. The default path can be changed at compile time 
      by passing the <tt>--with-sys-service=<em>DIR</em></tt>, <tt>--with-packager-service=<em>DIR</em></tt> and <tt>--with-user-service=<em>DIR</em></tt> to 
      <tt>./configure.</tt> It will run a parser on the frontend service file and write the result to the directory of the given <em>tree</em>&mdash;see <a href="66-tree.html">66-tree</a>. The <em>service</em> will then be available in the given 
      <em>tree</em> for the next boot depending on the state of the
      <em>tree</em>. The targeted service(s) can also be started on the fly when enabling it with the <tt>-S</tt> option.
    </p>
    <p>Multiple <em>services</em> can be enabled by seperating their names with a space.</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

	<ul>
	 <li> <tt>-h&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: prints this help. </li>
	 
	 <li>
		<tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em>&nbsp;</tt>: increases/decreases 
		the verbosity of the command. <tt>1(Default)</tt>: Only print 
		error messages. <tt>2</tt>: Also print warning messages. 
		<tt>3</tt>: Also print debugging messages.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: changes the supervision directory of <em>service</em> to <em>live</em>. By default this will be <tt>/run/66</tt>. The default can 
		also be changed at compile time by passing the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt>
		option to <tt>./configure</tt>. An existing absolute path is expected and
		should be within a writable filesystem - likely a RAM filesystem&mdash;see <tt><a href="66-scandir.html">66-scandir</a></tt>.
	 </li>
	 <li> 
		<tt>-t&nbsp;<em>tree</em></tt>&nbsp;: specifies the <em>tree</em> used to store
		the parsed <em>service</em> file. This option is mandatory
		except if a tree was marked as 'current'&mdash;see <a href="66-tree.html"><tt>66-tree</tt></a>.
	 </li>
	 
	 <li> 
		<tt>-f&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: reenables an already enabled <em>service</em> with the given options. This option will run again the process from the start and overwrite all existing files.
	</li>
	 
	<li> 
		<tt>-S&nbsp;</tt>&nbsp;: starts the <em>service</em> on the fly directly after enabling it. If the state of the <em>service</em> is already up, this option
		will have no effect unless the <tt>-f</tt> option is used to reload it.
	 </li>	 

	</ul>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependency handling</h2>
<p>For <em>services</em> of type <tt><em>'bundle'</em></tt> or <tt><em>'atomic'</em></tt> any existing dependency chain will be automatically resolved.
It is unnecessary to manually define chained sets of dependencies. If FooA has a declared dependency on another service with the name FooB then FooB will be automatically enabled too when enabling FooA.
This works recursively until all necessary dependencies are enabled.</p>

<h2 id="directory">Directory name as <em>service</em></h2>

	<p>When choosing to make a directory be recognised as service the path of the directory must exist by default at <tt>/etc/66/sysadmin/service</tt>, <tt>/etc/66/service</tt> or <tt>$HOME/.66/service</tt> depending of the owner of the process and the option given at compile time. All <em>service</em> files found in this directory will be enabled. The directory can contain a mixed set of <tt><em>bundle</em></tt> and <tt><em>atomic</em></tt> services where some of those depend on each other. The directory option is not limited to these types though. Any available service type can be part of the set.</p>
	<p>A good example is a set of services for the boot process. To achieve 
	this specific task a large number of <tt><em>oneshot</em></tt> services is used along with some <tt><em>classic</em></tt> 
	services.</p>
	<p>The parser automatically resolves any existing dependency chain for the processed <em>services</em> just as it would for any regular service.</p>
	<p>(!) This option and its mechanics can be subject to change in future releases of the 66-enable tool.</p>

<h2 id="instance">Instanced <em>service</em></h2>
	<p>An instanced <em>service</em> name from a service template can be passed as argument where the name of the <em>service</em> must end with a '@' (commercial at).
	&mdash;see <a href="frontend.html#instance"><tt>frontend service file</tt></a>.</p>
	<p>(!) The name of the template must be declared first immediately followed by the instance name as shown in the following example :
	<pre>    66-enable tty@tty1</pre></p>
	<p>Also an instanced <em>service</em> can be declared on the <em>@depends</em> field of the frontend service file.</p>
<h2 id="configuration"><em>Service</em> configuration file</h2>
	<p>If the <a href="frontend.html#environment">environment</a> section is set on the frontend service file, the parse result process can be found by default at <tt>/etc/66/conf</tt> for the root user and <tt>$HOME/.66/conf</tt> for a normal user. The default path can be changed at compile time by passing the <tt>--with-sys-service-conf=<em>DIR</em></tt> for the root user and <tt>--with-user-service-conf=<em>DIR</em></tt> for a normal user.</p>
